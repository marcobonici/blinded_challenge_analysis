# Analyzing Blinded Challenge simulations, using the Effort emulator
Repository containing the code necessary to analyze the simulations from the Blinded challenge.

The repository contains some scripts that can be used to run chains and produce plots
##  Run chains
In the `scripts` folder there is the `submitter.jl` script, which can be used to run the chains to analyze the japanese simulations (Nishimichi et al.). Run

``
julia submitter.jl --help
``
